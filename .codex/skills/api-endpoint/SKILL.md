description: Add a new Express route to LinkForge following our conventions.

## Steps

1. Add the route to `src/server.js`. Follow the existing response shape
   (`{ data: ... }` on success, `{ error: ... }` on failure).
2. Add matching storage logic to `src/store.js` if needed.
3. Write a test in `tests/` using `node:test` and `node:assert`, covering
   the success case and the 404 case.
4. Run `npm test` and make sure everything passes before finishing.
