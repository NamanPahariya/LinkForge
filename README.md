# LinkForge

LinkForge is a full-stack URL shortener built with React, Vite, Express, and Node.js. Submit an HTTP or HTTPS URL in the browser to create a compact link, copy it, inspect its details through the API, or follow it to the original destination.

## Requirements and setup

- Node.js 20.19 or newer (or Node.js 22.12+)
- npm

Install all dependencies from the repository root:

```bash
npm install
npm run install:all
```

Then start the frontend and API together:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs at `http://localhost:5173` and the API defaults to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Commands

Run these from the repository root:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Run the Express API and Vite development server |
| `npm start` | Start only the Express API |
| `npm test` | Run the backend test suite |
| `npm run build` | Create a production frontend build |
| `npm run install:all` | Install backend and frontend dependencies |

## Configuration

The server reads these optional environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `3000` | Express listening port |
| `BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` | Public origin used in generated short URLs |

The Vite app uses `VITE_API_URL` when it needs a non-default API origin. For example:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

Keep local values in `.env` files; they are ignored by Git.

## API

All API results use either `{ "data": ... }` or `{ "error": "..." }`.

| Method | Endpoint | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/health` | API health status |
| `POST` | `/api/urls` | Create a short URL from `{ "url": "https://example.com" }` |
| `GET` | `/api/urls/:shortCode` | Retrieve a stored URL record |
| `GET` | `/:shortCode` | Redirect to the original URL |

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/urls \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"url":"https://example.com/a-long-path"}'
```

Successful creation returns `201` with the original URL, generated `shortCode`, public `shortUrl`, creation time, and visit count. Invalid URLs return `400`; unknown codes return `404`.

## Testing and persistence

Tests use Node's built-in `node:test` runner and make requests to an ephemeral HTTP listener. Run them with `npm test` or directly with `npm test --prefix server`.

URL records currently live in an in-memory `Map`. Restarting the API deletes all created links, so use a persistent datastore before deploying this project for production use.
